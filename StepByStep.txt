Step-by-Step AMM DEX Development Guide
Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1-2)
Step 1: Project Setup & Research

Study Uniswap V2 whitepaper - Understand constant product formula (x * y = k)
Analyze existing AMM implementations - Study Uniswap V2, SushiSwap contracts
Set up project structure:

Initialize Hardhat project
Install dependencies (OpenZeppelin, math libraries)
Configure networks and deployment scripts


Design token architecture - Decide on ERC20 tokens you'll support

Step 2: Core Contracts Planning

Factory Contract - Manages pair creation and registry
Pair Contract - Individual liquidity pools
Router Contract - User-facing interface for swaps
LP Token Contract - ERC20 for liquidity provider shares
Library Contract - Mathematical calculations and utilities

Phase 2: Core AMM Logic (Week 3-4)
Step 3: Implement Factory Contract

Create pair creation functionality
Implement pair registry mapping
Add events for pair creation
Set up access controls for fee management
Test factory deployment and pair creation

Step 4: Build Pair Contract (Most Complex)

State variables:

Token addresses (token0, token1)
Reserves tracking
Total supply for LP tokens
Fee accumulation


Core functions:

mint() - Add liquidity, issue LP tokens
burn() - Remove liquidity, burn LP tokens
swap() - Execute token swaps
sync() - Update reserves to match balances


Mathematical implementations:

Constant product formula validation
LP token calculation (geometric mean for initial, proportional for subsequent)
Fee deduction (0.3% standard)
Minimum liquidity lock (prevent division by zero)



Step 5: Testing Phase 2

Unit tests for each Pair function
Integration tests between Factory and Pair
Edge case testing (zero amounts, overflow protection)
Gas optimization tests

Phase 3: Router & User Interface (Week 5-6)
Step 6: Router Contract Development

Liquidity functions:

addLiquidity() - Calculate optimal amounts, handle slippage
removeLiquidity() - Burn LP tokens, return underlying assets


Swap functions:

swapExactTokensForTokens() - Input amount known
swapTokensForExactTokens() - Output amount known
Multi-hop swap logic


Helper functions:

Price impact calculations
Slippage protection
Deadline validation
Path optimization for multi-hop



Step 7: Advanced Features

Price Oracle Integration:

Time-weighted average price (TWAP)
Cumulative price tracking
Oracle update mechanisms


Fee Mechanism:

Protocol fee toggle (0.05% to protocol)
Fee-on-transfer token support
Fee distribution logic



Phase 4: Security & Optimization (Week 7-8)
Step 8: Security Implementation

Reentrancy protection - Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
Access controls - Role-based permissions
Input validation - Check for zero addresses, amounts
Overflow protection - SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ built-ins
Flash loan protection - Block same-transaction price manipulation

Step 9: Gas Optimization

Storage optimization - Pack structs efficiently
Function optimization - Minimize external calls
Batch operations - Combine multiple actions
Assembly optimization - For critical math operations (advanced)

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 9-10)
Step 10: Comprehensive Testing

Unit tests - Each function in isolation
Integration tests - Full user journeys
Stress tests - Large amounts, edge cases
Fork tests - Test against mainnet state
Slippage tests - Various market conditions

Step 11: Frontend Integration Prep

Event emission - Ensure all important actions emit events
View functions - Add getter functions for frontend queries
Error handling - Custom errors with meaningful messages
Documentation - Function comments and README

Step 12: Deployment Strategy

Testnet deployment - Deploy to Goerli/Sepolia first
Verification - Verify contracts on Etherscan
Initial liquidity - Bootstrap some initial pairs
Monitoring setup - Track contract interactions

Key Learning Objectives Per Phase
Phase 1-2: Understanding AMM mechanics, implementing core math
Phase 3: User experience design, complex transaction flows
Phase 4: Production-ready security practices
Phase 5: Real-world deployment considerations
Success Metrics

 Can create new trading pairs
 Users can add/remove liquidity efficiently
 Swaps execute with correct pricing
 Multi-hop swaps work through optimal paths
 Price impact calculations are accurate
 All edge cases handled gracefully

Bonus Challenges (If you finish early)

Flash swap implementation - Borrow tokens, execute arbitrage, repay in same transaction
Concentrated liquidity - Uniswap V3 style range orders
Governance token - DAO voting for protocol parameters
Analytics dashboard - Track volume, TVL, fees earned
